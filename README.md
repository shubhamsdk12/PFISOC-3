# üåç AI-Driven ESG Intelligence Platform

## üß© Problem Statement

Current Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) rating systems rely on static reports and delayed data updates. They fail to capture **real-time ESG risks** and lack **geographical visibility** into where environmental or social issues occur. As a result, investors, regulators, and sustainability analysts struggle to obtain **dynamic, location-aware, and transparent ESG insights**.

---

## üí° Proposed Solution

We propose an **AI-driven ESG Intelligence Platform** that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Geo-Spatial Visualization** to deliver live, explainable ESG insights.

### üîß Core Features

1. **Real-Time Data Collection:**

   * Integrate APIs (Google News, GDELT, NewsCatcher, Reddit, etc.) to retrieve ESG-related data and articles.

2. **AI-Powered ESG Classification:**

   * Use NLP models to classify news into **Environmental**, **Social**, or **Governance** categories.
   * Perform **sentiment analysis** to determine positive, negative, or neutral ESG impacts.

3. **Predictive ESG Analytics:**

   * Implement ML algorithms (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to **forecast future ESG trends** and identify potential risk areas.
   * Predict how a company‚Äôs ESG score may change over time.

4. **Geo-Spatial Mapping:**

   * Visualize ESG incidents and trends on an **interactive map** using Leaflet or Mapbox.
   * Create **heatmaps** to show regions with high ESG risks or positive sustainability activity.

5. **Explainable AI (XAI):**

   * Use SHAP or LIME to make AI decisions **transparent** and **interpretable**.
   * Allow users to see **why** a particular ESG score increased or decreased.

6. **Interactive Dashboard:**

   * Display ESG scores, sentiment graphs, company profiles, and geo-based trends.
   * Enable filters for time, geography, and company comparisons.
