# 🌍 ESGTruth™: AI-Powered ESG Transparency & Scoring Platform

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores are increasingly used to evaluate companies’ sustainability and ethical impact. However, current ESG data often lacks **transparency, consistency, and real-time accuracy**. Most existing ESG scores rely on self-reported data or static assessments, which may be outdated, incomplete, or even misleading.

There is a pressing need for a system that can:

* Aggregate ESG data from diverse, credible sources (news, reports, NGOs, filings, etc.)
* Detect contradictions between what companies *claim* and what *evidence* supports
* Provide **real-time**, explainable, and transparent ESG insights for investors, regulators, and the public.

## 💡 Our Solution

**ESGTruth™** is an AI-powered platform that automates the collection, validation, and interpretation of ESG information in real-time.
It combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Knowledge Graphs**, and **Explainable AI** to generate a dynamic **Truth Consistency Index (TCI)** and visualize ESG data through an interactive dashboard and map.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Source ESG Data Aggregation**

* Ingests data from sustainability reports, verified news APIs, and NGO publications.
* Uses web scraping and API-based retrieval for real-time ESG-related updates.
* Accepts uploaded company reports in PDF or DOCX formats and automatically extracts ESG metrics.

### 2. **AI-Powered Claim Detection & Validation**

* NLP models identify ESG-related claims (e.g., “We reduced emissions by 40%”).
* Cross-verifies these claims against evidence from trusted third-party sources.
* Detects contradictions and generates a credibility score for each claim.

### 3. **ESG Intelligence Graph**

* Constructs a Knowledge Graph linking companies, metrics, sources, and verification results.
* Displays how claims connect to supporting or contradicting evidence.
* Helps visualize corporate relationships and dependencies.

### 4. **Truth Consistency Index (TCI)**

* A quantitative score (0–100) that measures how consistent a company’s public claims are with verified evidence.
* Incorporates Environmental, Social, and Governance sub-scores.
* Uses Bayesian or weighted models to adjust scores based on source credibility.

### 5. **Interactive Dashboard & Map Visualization**

* Displays company ESG scores and their geographic distribution.
* Shows heatmaps of ESG risks (e.g., pollution zones, labor violations, governance scandals).
* Provides time-series trends and region-wise ESG comparisons.

### 6. **GenAI Explainability Agent**

* Generates short, human-readable summaries explaining why a company’s claim was supported or contradicted.
* Highlights evidence and provides confidence levels for each conclusion.
* Enables transparency and traceability for every ESG score generated.

### 7. **Scenario & Risk Simulator**

* Allows users to simulate events (e.g., oil spill, layoffs, regulation changes) and observe predicted impacts on ESG scores.
* Helps investors and policymakers assess future risk exposure.

### 8. **APIs & Alerts**

* Provides REST APIs for accessing ESG and TCI scores programmatically.
* Sends alerts when a company’s ESG credibility significantly changes.

## 📊 ESG Score Calculation

Each company’s ESG score and **Truth Consistency Index (TCI)** are derived using:
[
TCI = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i × C_i)
]
Where:

* ( w_i ) = Weight assigned to each data source (based on credibility)
* ( C_i ) = Confidence of consistency between claim and evidence

Environmental, Social, and Governance sub-scores are calculated separately and then combined into the final TCI.
